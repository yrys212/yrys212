        <p>The 4 Basic Seasons</p>
        <p>The Color Me Beautiful theory is based on four colour types: üåø Spring, üå∏ Summer, üçÅ Autumn and ‚ùÑÔ∏è Winter. Which seasonal type you are depends on two basic variables:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>the undertone of your skin, hair and eyes (warm/golden vs cool/ashy)</li>
            <li>how light vs deep your overall colouring and specifically your hair is</li>
        </ul>
        <p>The seasons represent the four possible variations of these two variables: If your natural hair colour is lighter than medium brown, you would be typed as either a Spring or a Summer; if it‚Äôs darker you are a Winter or an Autumn. If your skin tone and hair have a warm undertone, or you are a natural red-head, you would be classed as either a Spring or an Autumn; if your skin has a blue-ish, cool undertone and your hair is more ashy and has no golden or red highlights, you are either a Summer or a Winter.</p>

<p>Note: This is a very stripped-down summary of the whole process. The original Color Me Beautiful material provides a much more detailed explanation and also outlines various exceptions (e.g. in very rare cases a Winter type can have almost platinum blond hair).</p>

<p>Below you'll find four quick profiles of the seasons and 12 typically suggested shades. Go through each profile and compare their descriptions to your own colouring (natural hair colour and bare skin!). Ignore your favourite colours and your wardrobe. For now you are trying to get an accurate view of your colour type and the colours that suit you best, regardless of whether you like them or not (we'll deal with disparaties in the next posts). If you find it difficult to figure out your season, you might be a less pronounced or more neutral type, and will have better luck with the more refined 12-type system (more on that below).</p>

<h3>THE 12 COLOUR TYPES</h3>
<p>If you immediately recognized your own colouring in one of these four seasons: congrats! If not, don't worry. Unless your colouring clearly matches one of the two sides of each variable (i.e. is obviously light vs dark and warm vs cool), figuring out which type you are might require a little digging. 

<p>This is where the updated Color Me Beautiful typology (based on 12 instead of 4 types) comes in. In order to a) accomodate for people whose colouring is close to neutral in either variable and b) to differentiate a bit better within the seasons, they added a secondary factor. This secondary factor depends on your colouring's most defining quality: light, deep, clear, soft, warm or cool.</p>

<p><b style="color:MediumSeaGreen;">Light</b>: You are either a <a href="https://i.pinimg.com/564x/59/16/e0/5916e04c9cbe728c02af77350a039cd5.jpg">light spring</a> or a <a href="https://i.pinimg.com/564x/36/fe/41/36fe41f9f3344b5c4d027d4531f82450.jpg">light summer</a>. Your hair colour is light (blond or light brown), your skin is light for your ethnicitiy and your eyes are either a light blue, green or grey. You look best in the soft, light and muted shades of your colour palette, e.g. peach (Spring) or a pale lavender (Summer).</p>

<p><b style="color:DarkGreen;">Deep</b>: You are either a <a href="https://i.pinimg.com/236x/40/48/bc/4048bca391909454b49a06c28c2ece31.jpg">deep winter</a> or a <a href="https://i.pinimg.com/736x/48/12/ea/4812ea89a419a6511b75d4cfaf6df558.jpg">deep autumn</a>. You have dark brown or black hair and deep brown, green or hazel eyes. You look amazing in the deep, vivid shades of your palette, e.g. deep terracotta (Autumn) or black (Winter).</p>

<p><b style="color:Salmon;">Warm</b>: You are either a <a href="https://i.pinimg.com/236x/92/9c/6d/929c6dde8c58c29e4f8674d55925372d.jpg">warm spring</a> or a <a href="https://i.pinimg.com/564x/00/6b/f1/006bf1eec6625b8fc08a6bdd57164407.jpg">warm autumn</a>. Your overall colouring has a distinctive warm undertone to it. Your hair is either golden blond to brown, or strawberry blond to deep auburn. Your eyes are green, topaz, hazel or light to medium brown. You best suit the mid-range colours in your palette that are neither too intense nor pale, e.g. a medium tomato red (Autumn) or a soft aquamarine (Spring).</p>

<p><b style="color:Pink;">Cool</b>: You are either a <a href="https://i.pinimg.com/474x/fc/44/48/fc4448537af6bcd7186bbee43ede8b2f.jpg">cool summer</a> or a <a href="https://i.pinimg.com/736x/70/0a/45/700a4594ab6402c80bb50ca4d27c0f71.jpg">cool winter</a>. Regardless of whether you have light or dark skin/hair, your overall colouring has an underlying cool quality to it. Like the warm type, you also look best in the mid-range shades of your palette, e.g. emerald green (Winter) or periwinkle (Summer).</p>

<p><b style="color:Purple;">Clear</b>: You are either a <a href="https://i.pinimg.com/736x/de/a9/d0/dea9d0f2214edcb5ad0426d93ada33f9.jpg">clear winter</a> or a <a href="https://i.pinimg.com/564x/b0/e0/da/b0e0dab5eace985db7597cb25c9ddbd0.jpg">clear spring</a>. Your overall colouring is high in contrast and saturation. Your hair is either a medium brown to black or a vivid, bright blond, your eyes are blue, bright green, topaz, amber or turquoise. You look best in saturated, clear colours, e.g. a bright, warm pink (Spring) or hot pink (Winter).</p>

<p><b style="color:MediumPurple;">Soft</b>: You are either a <a href="https://i.pinimg.com/564x/a5/14/00/a51400f1fb7d698fdc100e9916d2ba96.jpg">soft summer</a> or a <a href="https://i.pinimg.com/736x/b7/da/7e/b7da7ef4b522a813ab09989f9143e667.jpg">soft autumn</a>. There is little contrast between your skin, hair and eyes and your overall colouring is relatively close to neutral. Your hair is neither very light nor very dark. Your eyes are green, grey-blue, hazel or brown. You look best in soft, muted shades, e.g. olive green (Autumn) or blue teal (Summer).</p>
